the only thing i can say is that you need to bring it back tomorrow. and today. and the next day. because you 
only have one thing you want to become and that is great, nothing else will be enough for what has happened in 
syria. what can you do? you can help rebuild syria. you can build a charity for it and milk it enough to make
millions. but that could be the very devil's work. it runs the same risk as numbing yourself with drugs and 
even money. so how can you avoid these things? you can't really. it is within everything that you do. find a way
to make it all worth it, that's all im saying. you're good homie. try to get up early, kinda. do your things.
