The text game is Exercise 36 in Zed Shaw's book where we use basic Boolean variables, if-statements and raw_input to 
construct a text adventure game with dialogue. Can you get a job with Hugo Boss?

## How to run the game

The game is built to be run through the command line as part of the Zed Shaw programmes in his book. Python 2 should be installed for the .py file, to run, save the file 'ex36 hugo boss.py' in a local directory. Then open Powershell on windows or the command line on Mac and 'cd' to the directory. Then you will need to type "python 'ex36 hugo boss.py'" and hit enter to run the game. If you have python 3 installed, you repeat the same process but with the file 'hugo_boss_py3.py3'.
